# globetrotters
A game where we track someone around the globe.


Upon load the user will be taken to the "Welcome" page. Within the welcome there were be links to the "Game" and "About".

Once the user has clicked on "Game" the game will display a map, with the map linked to a different element for each possible country.

app.js will be linked to the "Game" page, and also be able to link to local memory.

The individual countries will link to an object which holds the scores, which will in turn be linked to the leader board.

The leader board is connected to local memory and will be associated with username that the user will input on the welcome page.

From either "Game" or "Welcome" the user can click a link to the "About" page, which holds information on all developers who worked on the project.

All pages will be linked to a central style page, with potential individual style pages for each individual page as necessary.
